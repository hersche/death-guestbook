This was a rapid-dev-project for scool. I reused a lot of the learncards-web-project (also on github).
The Website is also the demo :)
Normal user: test / 123456
Admin user: test2 / 123456

A normal user is a moderator (you needn't to be login for write in the guestbook), which could delete entrys.
The admin could also create new users and also could modify them. Delete for users isn't possible yet (but soon :) )

HF!
